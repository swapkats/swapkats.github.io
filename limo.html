      <p>limo (now <a href="https://h2oapp.in" target="_blank">h2o</a>) is a startup I've worked with from inception. In short it was uber for commute. Challenge was to build a truly seamless commute experience for office commuters in mumbai where commute is hell.</p>
      <p>In this project I've tried my hands on design, because why not? I worked closely on product design. I've always was an admirer of good products and I've been told many times I have good sense of design. So I worked on both design and frontend for this project.</p>
      <p>Because I was very quick with frontend development, I managed to do design as well. This made limo's design process very lean and agile. Their time to quickly iterate ideas to production improved significantly.</p>
